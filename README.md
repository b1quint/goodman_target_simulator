# Goodman Target Simulator

This is a very simple script that simulates Goodman data. At this moment, it simply generates an image with one or more gaussian 
profiles that mimic observations.

## To Do

  - [ ] Add distortions.
  - [ ] Poisson noise?
  - [ ] New Blue Camera and Red Camera templates.
  - [ ] Real spectral response?
